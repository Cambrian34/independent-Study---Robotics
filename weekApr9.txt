- After rigirous testing of the priority queue, i have detected a bug of commands being sent too quickly causing 
    the movement commands to be sent within the ack timeout, causing the robot to be stuck with a higher priority command controlling it 

- ive also moved the camera so that it see higher for seeing signs

- im currently working on refactoring the ARDUINO code to send back a flag when the command is received and executed

- Im now thinking of how to lower the latency between the arduino and the pi for faster command execution


Suggestion from professor

separate sensor reading form the main control.
